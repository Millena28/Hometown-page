            <h2>About Asmara</h2>
            <p>
                Asmara, the capital city of Eritrea, is often referred to as "Little Rome" due to its 
                remarkable Italian-inspired architecture. With its tree-lined streets, Art Deco buildings, 
                and rich history, Asmara is a city that combines the old and the new, tradition and modernity. 
                Located at an altitude of 2,325 meters (7,628 feet) above sea level, it enjoys a cool climate 
                throughout the year, perfect for leisurely strolls along its wide boulevards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city is a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognized for its well-preserved modernist architecture. 
                From cinemas to coffee houses, every corner of Asmara tells a story of its colonial past 
                intertwined with the cultural resilience of the Eritrean people.
